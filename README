Apache2::AuthEnv VERSION 1.0 - mod_perl2 authentication and
        authorisation control for Apache using only environment
        variables.

DESCRIPTION
Apache2::AuthEnv mod_perl2 authentication and authorisation control for
Apache using only environment variables. This is useful to control
access with some web server single sign-on solutions.

This code was written over a number of weekends to start learning
mod_perl2 but is actually useful. It could also be used as a framework
to build other mod_perl2 modules.
